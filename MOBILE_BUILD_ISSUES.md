# 🚀 Mobile Build Issues & Solutions

## ❌ Current Issues Identified

### 1. Android NDK Version Mismatch
- **Problem**: Your NDK version (26.3.11579264) vs required (27.0.12077973)
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Updated build.gradle.kts to use NDK 27.0.12077973

### 2. Record Plugin Compatibility
- **Problem**: record_linux package missing implementation for startStream
- **Impact**: Prevents successful build compilation
- **Solution**: Need to update or replace audio recording functionality

## 🔧 Quick Solutions

### Option 1: Temporary Audio Disable (Get Mobile Running Fast)
We can temporarily disable audio recording to get your app running on mobile, then add it back:

1. **Comment out audio recording** in AudioService
2. **Build for mobile** successfully  
3. **Test all other features** (text management, sidebar, etc.)
4. **Add audio back** with compatible package

### Option 2: Alternative Audio Package
Replace `record` package with `flutter_sound` which has better mobile compatibility:

```yaml
dependencies:
  # record: ^5.1.0  # Remove this
  flutter_sound: ^9.2.13  # Add this instead
```

### Option 3: Update Flutter SDK
Update to latest Flutter version which may have better package compatibility.
